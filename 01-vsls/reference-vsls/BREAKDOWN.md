# Reference VSL breakdown

Two reference VSLs, both uploaded to the [Reference VSLs release](https://github.com/eliascroesus/rickyvsl-clips/releases/tag/reference-vsls):

- **Iman Gadzhi, "AI Income Challenge"** (`imangadzhivsl.mp4`, 2:02, 1280×720)
- **AB Trades, "The Syndicate"** (`abnasdaqvsl.mp4`, 6:13, 1920×1080)

How this was done: both videos were pulled as stills every 1–2 seconds and looked at, cuts were detected
automatically, and the audio was measured: loudness, where speech is and isn't, music level under the voice,
how regular the beat is, what fills the gaps between words, and sharp sound-effect-like hits. Example stills
are in [`frames/`](frames/). Times are approximate (±2 s).

What this can't tell you: there's no transcript yet (the speech-to-text models can't be downloaded in this
environment), so the wording comes from the on-screen captions. Music is described by what can be measured
(level, whether it has a beat, when it plays); the tracks themselves aren't identified.

### Editing

- **Two angles, cut on sentence breaks.** A wide frontal shot and a tighter three-quarter close-up, switched
  every 2–5 seconds, always between sentences, never mid-word. That's what makes a static talking head feel
  like it's moving. ([`iman-09-two-angles.jpg`](frames/iman-09-two-angles.jpg))
- **Everything he names appears on screen.** Workbooks are shown as a mockup, the calculator as a screen
  recording, WhatsApp as a phone. The first 70 seconds are mostly graphics; the last 50 are mostly him.
- **Text cards** ([`iman-04-text-card.jpg`](frames/iman-04-text-card.jpg)): black background with a lime
  glow in one corner, a wide all-caps font (an extended geometric face like Druk Wide or Monument Extended),
  letters blur in left to right, one keyword underlined in lime, a small logo mark at the bottom.
- **Headline over the talking head** ([`iman-03-headline-over-aroll.jpg`](frames/iman-03-headline-over-aroll.jpg)):
  the same wide caps in white across the lower third, with a lime handwritten line under it. Used once, for
  the most important instruction.
- **Callout word** ([`iman-10-callout-word.jpg`](frames/iman-10-callout-word.jpg)): when he says the key
  term ("VIP upgrade"), the subtitle disappears and the term takes its place in big caps.
- **Screens are never shown raw.** Every screen recording sits in a rounded frame on the brand background,
  sometimes tilted, with the cursor visible ([`iman-06-screen-demo.jpg`](frames/iman-06-screen-demo.jpg),
  [`iman-08-page-walkthrough.jpg`](frames/iman-08-page-walkthrough.jpg)).
- **Subtitles**: white, bold clean sans (Inter / SF Pro style), sentence case, two lines of about 35
  characters, no box, soft shadow, lower middle. They move up when a headline takes the bottom.
- **One brand system**: black, white and one accent colour (lime). Nothing else.
- **Look**: dark, moody set with warm practical lights, shallow depth of field.

### Sound

- **There's always music under him, but it's soft and has no beat.** The gaps between his words sit around
  −36 dBFS (a clean room recording, like Ricky's raw, is around −64) and what fills them is tonal, not hiss.
  No drums or steady beat show up anywhere, so it's a pad or ambient-style bed. It falls away only after the
  last word.
- **Voice is heavily compressed and loud** (−12.9 LUFS, loudness range 2.6 LU): every word lands at the
  same level, which is part of why it feels relentless.
- **He talks the entire time.** Speech is detected in 89–99% of every 5-second window: no pauses, no dead air.
- **Sound effects on graphics.** Sharp, bright hits (typical of whooshes and pops) land on almost every switch
  into or out of a graphic: 0:05, 0:09, 0:16, 0:22, 0:27, 0:46, 0:52, 0:58, 1:02, 1:07, 1:10.

### Why it keeps attention

1. Open loop in the first 5 seconds ("your registration is not complete yet").
2. Something new on screen every ~3.7 seconds.
3. Every promise is shown, not just said.
4. One instruction repeated three ways (calculator, WhatsApp, button), so nobody gets lost.
5. Short: two minutes, one idea per section.

## AB Trades

![Word captions](frames/ab-02-word-captions.jpg)

### Structure

| Time | Beat | On screen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 | Hook: "Every one of these videos…" | Stacked mixed-style text beside him, flashes of a phone screenshot and a chart |
| 0:12 | Credential: "made over $750,000 in prop firm payouts" | Picture-in-picture card over a chart, then a big blue number with 3D money falling |
| 0:20 | Proof dump, ~2 minutes | Raw screen recordings of payout dashboards, emails and certificates, facecam top right |
| 2:10 | The problem isn't the strategy | Big numbers on white ($250,000), "Available balance $10" card |
| 3:10 | It's human instinct: his own blow-up story ("In February 2025… I blew $75,000") | White keynote cards, movie clips, 3D brain, burning money, alarm clock |
| 4:08 | One setup, decision fatigue | "ONE SETUP" in giant letters behind his head |
| 4:16 | The fix: someone reviewing your trades | Movie clips framed on white |
| 4:36 | The offer: The Syndicate (get in, get consistent, get out) | List in the empty side of the frame, an arrow marks the current point |
| 5:00 | Case study | Student photo card, before shot in black and white, the student's YouTube videos as proof |
| 5:20 | What's included | Split screen: him on the left, a list on black building line by line as he says it |
| 5:52 | Guarantee: a payout within 90 days or he works with you for free | Trophy, payout certificate, flying money |
| 6:02 | Call to action: fill out the application | "FOR FREE", "THE APPLICATION" in glowing blue caps |

### Editing

- **Word-group captions** ([`ab-02-word-captions.jpg`](frames/ab-02-word-captions.jpg)): 2–4 words at a
  time, one line, white, a tight Apple-style sans (SF Pro Display look), lowercase, soft shadow. They change
  every ~1 second, so something at the bottom of the frame is always moving.
- **Emphasis words** ([`ab-12-cta-emphasis.jpg`](frames/ab-12-cta-emphasis.jpg)): key words switch to bold
  caps in electric blue with a glow ("WORK WITH YOU", "FOR FREE", "THE APPLICATION").
- **Punch-ins**: one camera, but the framing alternates between wide and tight every few seconds.
- **White keynote cards** ([`ab-05-white-text-card.jpg`](frames/ab-05-white-text-card.jpg)): full-screen
  white with black text, built word by word. Used for transitions and story beats ("Now what exactly do I
  mean by this?", "In February of 2025").
- **Big-number cards** ([`ab-03-big-number.jpg`](frames/ab-03-big-number.jpg),
  [`ab-13-proof-card.jpg`](frames/ab-13-proof-card.jpg)): money in blue on white, with 3D money, coins or
  medals.
- **3D objects and stock** ([`ab-07-3d-object.jpg`](frames/ab-07-3d-object.jpg)): brain, burning cash, alarm
  clock, magnifying glass over a chart, trophy, money counter. Each lasts about a second.
- **Movie clips as metaphor** ([`ab-06-movie-clip.jpg`](frames/ab-06-movie-clip.jpg)): cinematic clips with
  the caption over them, sometimes framed on white.
- **Text in the empty side of the frame** ([`ab-09-negative-space-list.jpg`](frames/ab-09-negative-space-list.jpg)):
  lists sit beside him, with an arrow on the item he's talking about.
- **Text behind the subject** ([`ab-08-text-behind-subject.jpg`](frames/ab-08-text-behind-subject.jpg)):
  giant "ONE SETUP" with his head in front of the letters.
- **Split screen for the offer** ([`ab-11-split-screen-offer.jpg`](frames/ab-11-split-screen-offer.jpg)):
  each line appears exactly when he says it.
- **Raw proof** ([`ab-04-proof-screen-recording.jpg`](frames/ab-04-proof-screen-recording.jpg)): the proof
  section isn't polished; it's real dashboards and inboxes scrolled with a facecam, which reads as authentic.
  Gmail's yellow search highlights make the dollar amounts jump out.
- **Case study cards** ([`ab-10-case-study.jpg`](frames/ab-10-case-study.jpg)): photo in a white frame plus a
  one-line headline, then the student's own videos as proof.

### Sound

- **A soft bed under the talking.** The gaps between words sit around −43 dBFS and are tonal, with no
  detectable beat, so it's quieter and more in the background than Iman's.
- **A track with a steady beat takes over the proof section** (about 1:00–2:10). That's the only stretch with a
  clear rhythm, and twice he stops talking completely (about 1:00–1:18 and 1:39–2:07) while payouts scroll.
  It's a breather after a lot of talking, and it lets the numbers speak.
- **Quiet master** (−23.9 LUFS). On players that don't level the volume, this plays much quieter than other
  videos. Don't copy this part.
- **Sound effects on graphics.** Sharp, bright hits (typical of whooshes and pops) come about every 6 seconds;
  19 of them land exactly on cuts.

### Why it keeps attention

1. The hook promises to explain something every viewer has seen ("every one of these videos").
2. Proof comes in the first 20 seconds and keeps going for two minutes, so trust is built before the pitch.
3. A new cut every ~3.4 seconds and a new caption every ~1 second.
4. Every abstract idea gets a concrete picture (instinct = brain, losses = burning money, time = clock).
5. A personal failure story ("I blew $75,000") before the solution.
6. The offer is shown building line by line, so you watch it being assembled.
7. Risk reversal right before the call to action.

## What to take for Ricky's VSL

Ricky's raw recording (`rickyvslraw.mp4`, 6:25) is one fixed 4K camera: medium shot of him at a mic, shelves
with play buttons and YouTube boxes behind him, purple accents in the room. Around 4:00 there's a screen
recording of YouTube Studio with his face in the corner.

The AB video is the closer match in format (a ~6-minute VSL with a lot of proof). Iman's is the model for
polish and consistency. The plan:

- **Two angles from one camera.** Exporting the 4K footage at 1080p means it can be cropped in up to 2× with
  no loss, so there's a wide shot and a close shot, switched on sentence breaks every 3–5 seconds, like Iman.
  This also hides the cuts where pauses and mistakes are removed.
- **Captions like AB's**: 2–4 words at a time, with key words and numbers in one accent colour. Purple fits
  his room and his photos.
- **One brand system like Iman's**: black, white and the purple accent for every card, frame and caption.
- **Proof on screen within a second or two of every claim.** The pictures and clips in
  `02-results-and-b-roll/` cover views, subscribers, revenue, Shopify sales and lifestyle (see
  [ASSET-MAP.md](../../02-results-and-b-roll/ASSET-MAP.md)). Phone screenshots go in frames or device mockups
  on the brand background, never raw.
- **A proof montage with music only** for 10–20 seconds, like AB, if there's enough material.
- **Music**: a soft, beatless bed with no vocals under all the talking, far enough under his voice that it's
  felt more than heard, plus a track with a beat for the proof montage. Drop the music out for half a second
  right before the biggest lines.
- **Sound effects**: a soft whoosh when a graphic comes in, a pop or click when a number lands, a riser into
  the call to action. Sparingly.
- **Audio finish**: voice compressed and even like Iman's, final mix at about −14 LUFS with peaks under −1 dB.
- **No dead air**: pauses longer than about a third of a second get cut.

Still needed before editing:

1. **A transcript.** Either allow `huggingface.co` in this environment's network settings so speech-to-text
   can run here, or upload a transcript or `.srt` caption file of the raw video. Captions and cut points
   depend on it.
2. **Music.** Licensed tracks (Epidemic Sound, Artlist or similar) uploaded to the repo, since music can't be
   downloaded from here.
3. **Ricky's script or offer details** if the raw recording isn't the final script.
