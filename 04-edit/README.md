# Edit

How Ricky's VSL is put together. Nothing in here needs uploading; it's the editing setup.

## Pieces

- `scripts/transcribe.py`: word-level transcript of the raw video (Whisper large-v3-turbo) → `transcript.json`.
- `scripts/plan.py`: the edit itself. A cue sheet in raw-video time (titles, results cards, phone clips, number
  outlines, top labels, music sections, sound effects) plus pause cutting and caption grouping, compiled into
  `edl.json`.
- `scripts/render.py`: renders the video from `edl.json` and mixes the audio to −14 LUFS.
- `scripts/music.py` / `scripts/sfx.py`: the original score (A minor, 80 BPM, in layers) and sound effects,
  written from scratch, so there's nothing to license.
- `scripts/cards.py`: the results cards made from `02-results-and-b-roll/` (cropped, chargebacks and store name
  hidden, purple outline on the key number).
- `scripts/qa_audio.py` / `scripts/qa_frames.py`: checks: music level under the voice per section, and a still
  from every title, card, outline, clip and label.
- `scripts/voice_chain.txt`: the voice clean-up (low cut, clarity, compression, de-essing).

## Changing something

Edit the cue sheet at the top of `scripts/plan.py` (times are in the raw video, see
`03-raw-vsl-footage/TRANSCRIPT.md`), then run `plan.py` and `render.py` again.
